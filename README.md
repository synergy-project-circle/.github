# Circle

## Summary

The goal of this project is to Socialfy the adminâ€™s posts on announcements and events, providing an app where `admins` and `employees` can comment and react to posts.

## Long term vision

Circle will be a social media app where employees can share their personal interest with other employees on their spare time. The app will only feed `work` related posts during `work` hours, and then switches to `urgent` work-related posts and `personal` posts during non-working hours.
